# React to-do project

This is a simple website where users can add new to-do tasks, mark them as done as well as delete them. Tasks are stored in local storage. If there are tasks saved in local storage, then they will be set as initial value in the initial render.

# What does this project mean to me?

This mini project acts as a small mile stone of my journey of web development: learning React. Although there are still a lot to explore in the world of React, I still learned quite a few key concept about this popular framework. For example, when creating components, I need to think about their state as they would casue re-render behaviour. This leads to the learning of React life cycle. I learned some important hooks including useState, useEffect and useRef which also helped me to understand the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components. In addition, I also learned to style the react components using styled-components os that I don't need to import stylesheet.
